Tools for Text Analysis
=======================

About
-----

This is a collection of Python scripts and shell scripts for processing text corpora.
There are scripts for chunking texts, tagging, topic modelling, ngram-creation,
and network graphs.

Feel free to use, share, or modify, but don't blame me if something breaks.
I make no promises about the rigor or correctness of the code herein, but I have
found them useful.
